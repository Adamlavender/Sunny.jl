## Plotting

To reduce package load times, Sunny plotting functions are initially hidden, and only become available when the user explicitly executes "`using GLMakie`". It is a good idea to check that the [GLMakie](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl/tree/master/GLMakie) installation is working correctly (execute "`] test GLMakie`" from the Julia REPL).
